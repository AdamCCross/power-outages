# Introduction

In this project, I examin a dataset of all major power outages in the United States
from January 2000 to July 2016. These Outages are determined as major by the U.S.
Department of Energy for having impacted at least 50,000 customers or having caused
an unplanned loss of at least 300 MegaWatts. This data was sourced from Purdue
University and be accessed using the following link: https://engineering.purdue.edu/LASCI/research-data/outages
